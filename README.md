# AutoDatapackage
An attempt to automate combining datapack information, especially loot tables.

This problem is unsolvable using default information. However, an alternative soloution Smithed: Weld solves this problem by having developers provide additional information about how loot tables should be merged. Check out the [Smithed Platform](www.smithed.dev) for using Weld.
